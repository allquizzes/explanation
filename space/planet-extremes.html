<details><summary>Smallest Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Mercury</b><br>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is even smaller than the Moon. It has a diameter of 4879 km. It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU. Mercury has no moons. Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K).</details>
<details><summary>Largest Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Jupiter</b><br>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning.

Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.

Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well. <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-jupiter/en/">Visit here for more</a></details>
