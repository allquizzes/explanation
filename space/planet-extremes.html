<details><summary>Smallest Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Mercury</b><br>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is even smaller than the Moon. It has a diameter of 4879 km. Mercury has no moons. Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury/overview">Learn More</a></details>
<hr><details><summary>Largest Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Jupiter</b><br>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning.

Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.

Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview">Learn More</a></details>
<hr><details><summary>Closest Planet from Sun</summary>
<b>Ans- Mercury</b><br> Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.</details>
<hr><details><summary>Farthest Planet from Sun</summary>
<b>Ans- Neptune</b><br>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth is.

Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus.

Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see. <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-neptune/">Learn More</a></details>
<hr><details> <summary>Fastest Rotating Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Jupiter</b><br>Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in our Solar System rotating on average once in just under 10 hours. That is very fast especially considering how large Jupiter is. This means that Jupiter has the shortest days of all the planets in the Solar System.</details>
<hr><details><summary>Slowest Rotating Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Venus</b><br>Venus takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because it's so close to the sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus. Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the sun rises every 117 Earth days. That means the sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! More details about Venus in the Next Explanation</details>
<hr><details><summary>Hottest Planet</summary>
<b>Ans- Venus</b><br>Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun, it is still the hottest. It has a thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid. The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be puddles of melted liquid.Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger. Venus also has no moons <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview">Learn More</a></details>
